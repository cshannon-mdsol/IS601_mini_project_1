# Git Commands and Terminology

•   **Repository**

A repository is where all of a project’s files are stored along with their revision history

•   **Clone**

A clone is a copy of a repository kept in your local environment to allow you to work on files.

•   **Fork**

A fork is similar to a branch but the fork is not accessible from other team members on a project without being granted permission.

•   **Branch**

A branch runs parallel to a “master” branch or other branches off of master. Allowing you to work on files without impacting the original. You can push and pull the work done into or out of other parallel branches.

•   **Commit**

A commit is essentially a save. When you do work in Git and then commit, you’re saving your work along with a record of what was changed and by who. You can also write comments on commits to pass along information about your changes.
