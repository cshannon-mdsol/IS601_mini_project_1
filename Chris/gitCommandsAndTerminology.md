# Git Commands and Terminology

•   **Repository**

A repository is where all of a project’s files are stored along with their revision history

•   **Clone**

A clone is a copy of a repository kept in your local environment to allow you to work on files.

•   **Fork**

A fork is similar to a branch but the fork is not accessible from other team members on a project without being granted permission.

•   **Branch**

A branch runs parallel to a “master” branch or other branches off of master. Allowing you to work on files without impacting the original. You can push and pull the work done into or out of other parallel branches.

•   **Commit**

A commit is essentially a save. When you do work in Git and then commit, you’re saving your work along with a record of what was changed and by who. You can also write comments on commits to pass along information about your changes.

•   **Merge**

A merge is when you bring two branches back together and combine the work done in one or both of the branches.

•   **Checkout**

A checkout in Git is similar to checking out a book in a library. You can check out different branches or commits within those branches to view what they looked like at that time. The checkout updates the files in the working directory to the way they were at the time of commit. Even though you may be looking at old commits you can still do work and commit again.

•   **Push**

A push is essentially sending your local commits to a remote repository.

•   **Pull**

A pull is the opposite of a push where you are retrieving changes from a remote repository. Possibly because someone else has pushed changes to that repository and you want to pull those changes down to your working copy.
